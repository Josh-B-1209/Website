    <h1a class="skillsheading"> Overview </h1a>

    <P class="maintext"> 
      When Bambu lab released the X1 Carbon in 2022 the 3d printing industry was taken by storm with it's features which at the time seemed to good to be true, lidar first layer inspection, 20k mm^2 acceleration and tk Fast forward to present day these features have now become the standard and Bambu Lab has redefined what is considered a quality 3d printer. However as mentioned by Dr Tau himself the CEO of Bambu Lab, "the X1 Carbon is far from perfect". That's when Joshua Wise from "X1 Enhanced" formally known as "X1 Plus" took it upon himself to launch custom, open source firmware in 2023 for the X1 series printers. It doesn't replace the existing firmware but rather acts as an additional firmware layer running alongside the existing firmware. It gave X1 printer owners long requested features such as enhanced network security, password protection, visualisation of the autobed leveling data, custom splash screen images and many, many more features. 
    </P>

    <P class="maintext">
      Recently this open source project has expanded with the addition of new hardware related features through the X1 tk, such as ethernet, external camera shutter control, rgb led indicators and USB ports. As this is open source and having had author's Chamber Heater modification in mind I developed a chamber heater controller. Featuring an AC power input for fast heat up and no modifications to the printers existing switch mode power supply, i2C flash IC for the main carrier printed circuit board(PCB) to automatically detect what add on PCB has been connected to a port as well as optocouplers for signal isolation and therefore enhanced safety. This drop in PCB enables the printer to precisely control the build chamber temperature through G code sent from the slicer software, enabling the printer to reliably print cracking prone materials such as ABS (), PC (Poly Carbonate) or PA (Nylon). Together with authors "Bento Box" chamber filter you effectively have an X1 E printer for half the price.
